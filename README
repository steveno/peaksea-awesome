This is an awesome theme based off of the peaksea color theme for VIM.
            http://steveno.github.io/peaksea-awesome/

The initial start for this theme was the zenburn theme included with 
awesome by default. I copied all the icons and the changed the 
background to match. 
             http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/

The colors are still a work in process, so don't be surprised to see 
a very zenburn-esque pallet. As always contributions are welcome!

Outside of those two credits the rest of the work thus far has been 
all mine.
