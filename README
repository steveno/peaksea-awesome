This is an awesome theme based off of the peaksea color them for VIM.
        http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=760

The initial start for this theme was the zenburn theme included with 
awesome by default. I copied all the icons and the changed the 
background to match. 

The colors are still a work in process. As always contributions are
always welcome!

Outside of those two credits the rest of the work thus far has been 
mine (Steven Oliver).
