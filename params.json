I copied all the icons and the changed the \r\nbackground to match.         \r\n\r\nThe colors are still a work in process, so don't be surprised to see \r\na very zenburn-esque pallet. As always contributions are welcome!\r\n\r\nOutside of those two credits the rest of the work thus far has been \r\nall mine.\r\n\r\n--Steven Oliver\r\n","name":"Peaksea-awesome","google":""}
